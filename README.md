## Overview

This challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

- Build out the project based on the design given.  I only have the free version of FrontEnd Mentor so, I am only given screenshots essentially, no Sketch or Figma files to show dimensions.  The challenge was to recreate the design by estimating the dimensions, spacing, etc.

## My process

First I looked at the design image and thought about how it could be broken up into elements so that it could be styled.  Once the html was written I used SASS to style the elements to get them as close to the design image as I could considering we arent given the dimension of anything.  I continued to tweak my scss file until I was happy with the design.  Last, I figured out how to position the svg elements to create a custom background.  Peridically I uploaded my files to my github to save my progress.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSSS / SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to switch from using CSS to SASS.  I installed the Live SASS compiler to VS Code and paid attention to the console when it found errors in my code.  I learned how to use mixins to create a function with the display flex attributes so I wouldnt have to repeat code.  I also learned how to use position absolute and position relative to move the profile image where I wanted it to go along with the svg images behind the card.

### Continued development

I want to continue to get comfortable transition from CSS to SASS.  I wathched a short YouTube video, but im there are more tips and tricks I have yet to learn.  I also need to work on CSS positioning.  I solved the problem with trial and error, but id like to know why it worked.
